# Minimal Frontend Boilerplate

Including:

- React 16.8 (the one with hooks)
- Styled Components
- Parcel
- Babel 7
- ESLint and Prettier

## Description
A minimal quick-start boilerplate for frontend projects using contemporary libraries and tooling.
This is mostly for my own convenience.

## Run
To run a local build:

```console
yarn run
```

## Build
To create an optimised build in `dist/` :

```console
yarn build
```

## Lint
This project includes a husky/git pre-commit hook to run `prettier --write` and `eslint --fix` on staged files.

To manually lint:

```console
yarn lint
```
